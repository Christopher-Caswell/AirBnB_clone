"""
Write a program called console.py that contains
the entry point of the command interpreter:
-
You must use the module cmd
Your class definition must be:
class HBNBCommand(cmd.Cmd):
_
Your command interpreter should implement:
quit and EOF to exit the program
help (this action is provided by default by cmd but you
should keep it updated and documented as you work through tasks)
a custom prompt: (hbnb)
-
an empty line + ENTER shouldnâ€™t execute anything
Your code should not be executed when imported
